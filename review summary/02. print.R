# print () -> if print string-> print('AAA' or "AAA")  / if number just print ()
print (2)
print ('Hello') ;  print("Hello")
print (pi) #some defined&named numbers such as 'pi' = 3.1416 can be just written as its name
print (pi, digits = 3) #for infinite decimals -> give the limit to digits

# print(3,4)  or print('a', 'b') -> doesn't print both 
#to print more than one data at once
cat (1, 'a', '\n', 4, T, pi)  # cat( , , , ..) -> print multiple data 
4; 3; pi; 'a' #in R, just type the name of variable or values and it works exactly like print
